        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is authentic Italian spaghetti carbonara, prepared in the classic way — no cream whatsoever. Its rich, silky sauce comes entirely from eggs and cheese. A dish worthy of royalty, it’s a perfect example of how pure simplicity can deliver extraordinary results.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>175g / 6 oz guanciale (pancetta or block bacon)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>100g / 3.5 oz parmigiano reggiano, finely shredded</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>400g / 14 oz spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cooking/kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pasta cooking water</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, finely minced</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Garnish (optional)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Parsley</li>
            <li>Parmigiano regianno</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the guanciale</strong> – Slice it into roughly 0.5 cm (about 1/5 inch) strips, then cut those into small batons.</li>

            <li><strong>Make the carbonara base</strong> – In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and yolks until smooth. Add the cheese and pepper, mixing until fully combined.</li>

            <li><strong>Cook the pasta</strong> – Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions.</li>

            <li><strong>Save pasta water</strong> – Just before draining, scoop out about 1 cup of the starchy pasta water. Then drain the pasta.</li>

            <li><strong>Crisp the guanciale</strong> – While the pasta cooks, place the guanciale in a cold nonstick pan and heat over medium-high. Cook for 4–5 minutes until browned and the fat has rendered. If adding garlic, stir it in during the final minute.</li>

            <li><strong>Toss pasta in the pan</strong> – Add the hot spaghetti straight into the pan and coat it thoroughly in the rendered guanciale fat.</li>

            <li><strong>Combine with the sauce</strong> – Transfer the pasta and the pan drippings into the bowl with the egg mixture. Pour in about 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water and stir vigorously for a minute until the sauce becomes creamy and clings to the noodles.</li>

            <li><strong>Serve</strong> – Dish the pasta into warm bowls. Serve right away, adding extra parmesan, black pepper, and chopped parsley if you like.</li>
        </ol>
