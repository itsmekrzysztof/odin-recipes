        </ul>
            <h3>White Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>5 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 cups full-fat milk</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 cup parmesan, freshly grated</li>
            <li>1 tsp sea salt and pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>Lasagne</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb fresh lasagna pasta sheets</li>
            <li>2 balls mozzarella</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Ragu</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely dice the carrot, onion, and celery, then gently sauté them in a large pan with olive oil until softened. Stir in the ground beef and pork and cook until the meat is browned.</li>
            <li>If the mixture releases too much fat, carefully spoon some out. Pour in the red wine and simmer until it has reduced by half.</li>
            <li>Once the wine has cooked down, mix in the passata, tomato paste, bay leaves, 4 cups of beef stock, and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Combine well and let the sauce gently simmer uncovered for 2.5–3 hours over low heat. Add the remaining beef stock halfway through cooking.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>White Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a saucepan until it becomes foamy.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and stir to create a smooth paste. Cook for about a minute to remove the raw flour taste.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk in half of the milk, stirring constantly so no lumps form. Once the mixture begins to thicken, add the remaining milk, nutmeg, parmesan, and a little salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Keep stirring over low heat until the sauce thickens enough to coat a spoon. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assemble the lasagne</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
            <li>Start assembling the lasagna by spreading a thin layer of ragu across the bottom of your baking dish. Place a layer of lasagna sheets over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spoon more ragu over the pasta so it is fully covered, then top with a generous amount of white sauce.</li>
            <li>Continue layering pasta, ragu, and béchamel until everything is used, keeping enough béchamel for the top layer. Aim for 4–5 layers of pasta.</li>
            <li>Tear the mozzarella into pieces and scatter it over the final layer. Bake for about 45 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbling.</li>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for 5–10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
